        <!--Here is the short story of how I found web development-->
        <p>
          While working as a bookkeeper for a small company, I was lucky enough to get the opportunity to learn a bit of code to maintain a website. I was instantly hooked and wanted to dig deeper.
        </p>
        <p>I found out that:
          <ol>
            <li>It is just as creative as it is technical.</li>
            <li>There is always something new to learn.</li>
            <li>And there is a community of developers that support each other.</li>
          </ol>
        </p>
